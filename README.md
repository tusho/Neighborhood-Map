### Install the App

In your command line, type `npm install`.

### Start the App

Type `npm start` in order to run the app. This will open your browser, but in case it does not, open `http://localhost:3000` to view it manually.

### Service Worker

The service worker will only work in build mode. In order to run the service worker in build mode, type the following command: `npm run build`. If not yet installed on your local machine, run `npm install -g serve` followed by `serve -s build`. 

This will let you run the app in build mode and test the service worker.
